		<h3>What is AAA Testing?</h3>
		<p>AAA testing is a pattern for writing unit tests. Testing provides an empirical feedback loop for development. Testing can keep us safe by letting us know when things break and without tests, coding can be dangerous.<br>
		The pattern focuses each test on a single function. Arrange-Act-Assert is a great way to structure test cases. It prescribes an order of operations:</p>
		<ol>
			<li><p>Arrange inputs and targets. Arrange steps should set up the test case. Does the test require any<br>
				objects or special settings? Does it need to prep a database? Handle these operations at the start of the test.</p></li>
			<li><p>Act on the target behavior. Act steps should cover the main thing to be tested. This could be calling a function or method. Keep actions focused on the target behavior</p></li>
			<li><p>Assert expected outcomes. Act steps should elicit some sort of response. Assert steps verify the goodness or badness of that response. Assertions will ultimately determine if the test passes or fails.i</p></li>
		</ol>

		<h3>Unit Test Example</h3>
		<p>Here is a unit test, testing the addition operation on a calculator program</p>
		<img src="aaa.png" border= 0 style="display:block">
		<ol>
			<li>The arrange step creates a variable named "my_numbers" with the values of 1.0 and 2.0</li>
			<li>The act step instantiates an Addition object</li>
		</ol>
